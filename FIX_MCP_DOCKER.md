# ðŸ”§ Fix MCP_DOCKER Error

## Problem Identified
The MCP_DOCKER server is failing because Docker is not accessible in your WSL2 environment.

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Enable Docker Desktop WSL2 Integration (Recommended)

1. **Open Docker Desktop on Windows**
   - Make sure Docker Desktop is running

2. **Enable WSL2 Integration**
   - Go to Docker Desktop Settings â†’ Resources â†’ WSL Integration
   - Enable integration with your WSL2 distro
   - Apply & Restart

3. **Verify Docker Access in WSL2**
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   - Close and reopen Claude Desktop to reload MCP servers

### Option 2: Remove Docker-based MCP Servers (Quick Fix)

If you don't need Docker-based MCP functionality, you can remove or comment out any Docker-based servers:

1. **Edit Configuration**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. **Look for any servers that require Docker** and either:
   - Remove them entirely
   - Add them to a "disabled" section

### Option 3: Use Alternative Non-Docker MCP Servers

Your current configuration already has many non-Docker MCP servers that should work:
- âœ… desktop-commander
- âœ… railway-mcp  
- âœ… supabase-mcp
- âœ… github
- âœ… mcp-redis
- âœ… filesystem
- âœ… And many others...

## Current Status of Your MCP Servers

### Working Servers (Non-Docker):
- desktop-commander - System operations
- railway-mcp - Railway deployment
- supabase-mcp - Database operations
- github - Git operations
- mcp-redis - Redis cache
- filesystem - File operations
- And 13+ others

### Potentially Docker-Dependent:
- Any custom MCP servers that run in containers
- Trading-specific MCP servers that might need Docker

## Recommended Action

Since you're working on the trading dashboard:

1. **For Development**: The Docker issue won't block your progress - all essential MCP servers are non-Docker based

2. **For Production Trading**: You'll eventually want Docker working for:
   - Containerized trading services
   - Isolated execution environments
   - Better security and scalability

3. **Immediate Fix**: Just ensure Docker Desktop is running on Windows with WSL2 integration enabled

## Test After Fix

Run this command to verify:
```bash
# Test Docker
docker run hello-world

# Test MCP servers in Claude
# Just check if the error persists in Claude Desktop
```

The error should disappear once Docker is accessible in WSL2.
