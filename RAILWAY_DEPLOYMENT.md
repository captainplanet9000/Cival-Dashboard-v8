## 🌐 Post-Deployment URLs

Your Railway deployment will provide:
- **Main App**: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- **API Health**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- **Dashboard**: `https://your-app.railway.app/dashboard`

## 🔍 Deployment Verification Steps

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

### 2. Dashboard Access
- Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/dashboard`
- Should load with all tabs functional

### 3. API Endpoints Test
```bash
# Portfolio data
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/portfolio

# Market data  
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/market/overview

# Agent status
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/agents
```

### 4. WebSocket Connection
- Open browser developer tools
- Check Network tab for WebSocket connections
- Should see real-time data flowing

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Environment Variables
- **All 140+ variables** are configured in Railway
- **SOLO_OPERATOR_MODE=true** - No authentication required
- **ENABLE_PAPER_TRADING=true** - Safe simulation mode
- **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT=true** - Production optimizations

### Database Setup
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor if needed
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
-- Additional schema will auto-initialize
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Memory**: 512MB-1GB recommended
- **CPU**: 0.5-1 vCPU sufficient for start
- **Scale**: Auto-scaling enabled in railway.toml

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   railway logs --deployment
   # Check for missing dependencies
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Issues**
   ```bash
   railway variables
   # Verify all 140+ variables loaded
   ```

3. **Database Connection**
   ```bash
   # Test Supabase connection
   railway run -- node -e "console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL)"
   ```

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Increase Railway plan if needed
   - Check memory usage in logs

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Railway Metrics
- **CPU Usage** - Monitor in Railway dashboard
- **Memory Usage** - Auto-scaling configured
- **Response Times** - Health checks every 30s
- **Error Rates** - Logs available in dashboard

### Application Logs
```bash
# View real-time logs
railway logs --follow

# View specific deployment
railway logs --deployment <deployment-id>
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ **Health endpoint** returns 200 OK
- ✅ **Dashboard loads** without errors
- ✅ **WebSocket connects** (see browser network tab)
