The user's initial request was to \"complete phaes 2 - 5\" and while substantial progress has been made, Phase 4 and 5 are not yet complete. However, since the user explicitly asked to \"push final updates\", they may want to push the current state and complete the remaining components in a future session..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."}]},"uuid":"b12f99a0-4701-4f5b-a90b-db48055bd908","timestamp":"2025-06-21T19:16:02.023Z"}
